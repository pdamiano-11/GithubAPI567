### HW04a
When I was designing the code for this homework, I was thinking that I knew how to make a GET request, but then I thought why not make a POST request. I then looked up the difference between what a GET request and a POST request was. Once I realized that the GET request was the proper way to go according to REST practices, I looked up how to implement the requests package and parse the resulting json using the json package. I faced some initial challenges with getting the proper response body from the parsed json, but once I had figured it out, I treated the result like a python dictionary and just wrote the rest of the function. To make it easy to test, or at least the way I saw it as being easy to test the requirements, I had the function return a dictionary object. The requirements specified that the function had to show the specific repo and the amount of commits the repo had. As such, the dictionary keys are the names of the repo and the values belonging to the keys are the number of commits. This made it easy to later test if a specified repo was in the reponse object by looking at just the keys and if the number of commits for another repo matched the necessary amount. Another issue I ran into at this time was that the JSON response only returned 30 items maximum, so I only got 30 commits for repos that I tested that had 90 commits. I worked my way around this by using repos with less than 30 commits. Overall, this was a fun homework assignment and it was nice to have a refresher for API requests and the role they play in RESTful APIs.


### For HW05a, I used pytest like I did before and pytest-mock in place of just mock to patch my function calls.
